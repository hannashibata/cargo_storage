			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				LA MENTE is a Japan Natural Laboratories' skincare brand that started around 2000, focusing on creating
				gentle skincare for delicate skin. The most unique feature of the brand is its exceptional formula and traceability of all the ingredients it uses. The company is part of a group that manufactures and processes raw materials for cosmetic ingredients. The amount and the concentration of active ingredients are incomparable to any&nbsp;other.

				<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
				<p>
					But how did they start to suffer as a brand? &mdash; The answer was the neglected brand&nbsp;equity.
				</p>

				<p>
					For almost 20 years, LA MENTE hasn't changed its design or brand lineup. While the brand was eating up its brand equity for more than 10 years, it was also suffering from scalping and cheap sales and desperately needed to develop new customers. Alongside the unauthorized reselling, another factor that destroyed the brand value was the loss of the guidelines and design&nbsp;regulations.
				</p>

				<p>
					What can be a solution to this? &mdash; It was <em>expanding</em> the brand with adding new lineup and <em>renewing</em> the design language for the existing&nbsp;lineup.

						<h4>Solution: Brand Expansion</h4>
						<p>
							The first step to approach the project was rigorous research. It involved sorting out the
							remaining
							products in every size and material and analyzing customer and sales data. Based on the
							examinations and the budget, I restated the brand and adjusted the overall visual design of
							the&nbsp;product.</p>

						<p>
							Determined to create an exciting experience, I designed the package using glimmering silver
							and
							shimmering black. Although they are usually white or brown, I made protective liners in
							black to
							enhance the overall visual. This visual makes the budget jump; I solved the issue and
							logistical
							processes by simplifying the structure and reducing the amount of&nbsp;material.

							efficient distribution process for internal&nbsp;stakeholders.</h3>

						<h4>Solution: design renewal</h4>
						<p>
							Starting by researching the consumer experience, brand history, and surveys in every
							internal division involved, I set three goals for this project: (1) Preserve the initial
							brand value, (2) improve the brand communication and out-of-box experience, and (3)clarify
							the campaign schedule and product&nbsp;release.
						</p>

						<p>
							In executing the new visual design, I continued using the iconic, fresh color scheme of
							white and green while adjusting the shade to adhere to the upcoming&nbsp;generation.

				<h3>Internal Proposal</h3>
				<p>
					After the market research and competitive analysis, my team and I created a proposal deck to start
					the project. The 12-page deck begins by showing the renewed brand vision and statement alongside the
					renewed design. This deck also answers questions that the internal groups should have
					moving&nbsp;forward.
				</p>

				<p>
					This deck was a rationale for the brand refresh and a translation of a design project for members
					who are not familiar with brand strategy. A significant chapter in the deck was the development
					schedule and a plan for both the release schedule and the marketing campaign for the following two
					years.
