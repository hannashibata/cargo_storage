			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				This project is a studio practice inspired by actual gender discrimination in the medical field, aiming to unite and empower medical students and professionals fighting against&nbsp;discrimination.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the summer of 2018, the public discovered that Tokyo Medical University in Japan has been discriminating against students based on their gender and age on the entrance exam. This school was not the only institute involved in this incident, and even now, gender discrimination is still occurring in the academic and professional fields of&nbsp;medicine.

			<h4>Solution & Outcome</h4>
			<p>
				After discovering the incident, I contacted doctors and interviewed three in Japan over the 13-hour difference and conducted an online survey, which received more than 30 responses, mostly revealing their appalling experience of&nbsp;discrimination.
			</p>

			<p>
				The visual language aimed to show how discrimination is happening right now. The amount of pink in each poster is precisely 83.8%, the ratio of doctors who shared their experience of gender discrimination in the survey. Quotes also come from the actual words from&nbsp;them.

			</p>

			<p>
				I also chose to use English and Japanese for this project, pairing typefaces that should get along side by side in different environments. There is still an enormous gender gap in the industry, and two languages should allow the discourse of gender discrimination as a global&nbsp;issue.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the doctors who participated in the survey later contacted me and told me that she is now working to organize a cohort of doctors to fight gender discrimination in her&nbsp;workplace.
