			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				Fathom Optics Inc. comes from the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/spinoffs/overview/" target="_blnak">Media Lab Spinoff at MIT</a>. They have a brand new idea about the next-generation print.  At the very early stage of a startup, Fathom had a <em>logotype</em> designed by their brother, with a <em>tagline</em> they came up, <em>typefaces</em> they chose, and a <em>brand guideline that no one really understood</em>. They were also struggling to create a cohesive brand communication and resources, so I volunteered myself as a lead graphic designer to make clear and easy guidelines and build a branding&nbsp;strategy.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project started by recognizing and rebuilding its brand identity. Alongside the brand guideline, I
				suggested a few templates for social media content. I also created communication tools such as
				letterhead, folder-type envelopes for sending out the samples, business cards, etc., to support the
				overall brand communication and&nbsp;experience.

			<h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
			<p>
				My colleagues had little experience understanding brands and how brand regulations can help preserve a
				consistent narrative when handled well. I wanted to help them by reorganizing the guidelines and making
				them simple and easy to&nbsp;use.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Fathom handles many prints and communicates through various social media channels, consistency was
				the top priority. One challenge was the logotype's scalability and&nbsp;replicability.

			<h4>SOLUTION</h4>
			<p>
				I talked to everyone inside and outside the design team to ensure that our publications followed the
				guidelines. I also started the conversation with the founders and the team about what our brand voice
				should sound like. It was a great exercise for everyone, allowing us to think deeper about the brand and
				elevate the company-wide communication&nbsp;strategy.
			</p>

			<p>
				I set each guideline for digital/non-digital settings and made it as simple as possible, preserving the
				details, so the new corporate identity would help elevate the brand&nbsp;experience.
