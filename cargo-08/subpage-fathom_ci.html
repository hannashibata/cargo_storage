			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.fathomoptics.com/">Fathom Optics Inc.</a> comes from the <a
					href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/spinoffs/overview/" target="_blnak">Media Lab Spinoff at
					MIT</a>. They have a brand-new idea about next-generation printing. At the very early stage of a
				startup, Fathom had a logotype with a tagline designed by <a
					href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-hirsch-15b48ba3/" target="_blank">one of the founders’
					brother</a>, typefaces they chose, and a brand guideline that was not quite familiar to everyone.
				They were also struggling to create cohesive brand communication and resources, so I volunteered to
				develop clear and easy-to-follow guidelines and help build a brand&nbsp;visual identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project started by recognizing and rebuilding its brand identity. Alongside the brand guideline, I
				suggested a few templates for social media content. I also created communication tools such as
				letterhead, folder-type envelopes for sending out samples, business cards, etc., to support the overall
				brand communication and&nbsp;experience.

			<h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
			<p>
				My colleagues had little experience understanding brands and how brand regulations can help preserve a
				consistent narrative when handled well. I wanted to help them by reorganizing the guidelines and making
				them simple and easy to&nbsp;use.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Fathom handles many prints and communicates through various social media channels, consistency was
				the top priority. One challenge was the logotype's scalability and replicability. For instance, I found
				out that there were <em>three different shades of logo files</em> used among my colleagues—what is the
				best way to address this when they are not aware of the&nbsp;issue?

			<h4>SOLUTION</h4>
			<p>
				I talked to everyone inside and outside the design team to ensure that our publications followed the
				guidelines. I also started the conversation with the founders and the team about what our brand voice
				should sound like. It was a great exercise for everyone, allowing us to think deeper about the brand and
				elevate the company-wide communication&nbsp;strategy.
			</p>

			<p>
				I set each guideline for digital/non-digital settings and made it as simple as possible, preserving the
				details, so the new corporate identity would help elevate the brand&nbsp;experience.
