			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				LA MENTE is a Japan Natural Laboratories' skincare brand that started around 2000, focusing on creating
				gentle skincare for delicate skin. The most unique feature of the brand is its unique formula and
				traceability of all the ingredients it uses. The company is part of a group that manufactures and
				processes raw materials for cosmetic ingredients. The amount and the concentration of active ingredients
				are incomparable to any&nbsp;other.

			<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
			<p>
				But how did they start to suffer as a brand? &mdash; The answer was the neglected brand equity.
			</p>
			<p>
				For almost 20 years, LA MENTE hasn't changed its design or brand lineup. While the brand was eating up
				its brand equity for more than 10 years, it was also suffering from scalping and cheap sales and
				desperately needed to develop new customers. Alongside the unauthorized reselling, another factor that
				destroyed brand equity was the loss of the brand guidelines and design&nbsp;regulations.

			<h4>Solution: Brand Eepansion</h4>
			<p>
				The first step to approach the project was rigorous research. It involved sorting out the remaining
				products in every size and material and analyzing customer and sales data. Based on the examinations and
				the budget, I restated the brand and adjusted the overall visual design of the&nbsp;product.
			</p>
			<p>
				Determined to create an exciting experience, I designed the package using glimmering silver and
				shimmering black. Although they are usually white or brown, I made protective liners in black to enhance
				the overall visual. This visual makes the budget jump; I solved the issue and logistical processes by
				simplifying the structure and reducing the amount of&nbsp;material.

			<h4>Solution: design renewal</h4>
			<p>
				Starting by researching the consumer experience, brand history, and surveys in every internal division
				involved, I set three goals for this project: (1) Preserve the initial brand value, (2) improve the
				brand communication and out-of-box experience, and (3)clarify the campaign schedule and
				product&nbsp;release.
			</p>
			<p>
				In executing the new visual design, I continued using the iconic, fresh color scheme of white and green while adjusting the shade to adhere to the upcoming&nbsp;generation.
