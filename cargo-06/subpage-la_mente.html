			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				LA MENTE is a Japan Natural Laboratories' skincare brand that started around 2000, focusing on creating
				gentle skincare for delicate skin. The most unique feature of the brand is its unique formula and
				traceability of all the ingredients it uses. The company is part of a group that manufactures and
				processes raw materials for cosmetic ingredients. The amount and the concentration of active ingredients
				are incomparable to any other.

			<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
			<p>
				But how did they start to suffer as a brand? â€” The answer was the neglected brand equity.
			</p>
			<p>
				For almost 20 years, LA MENTE hasn't changed its design or brand lineup. While the brand was eating up
				its brand equity for more than 10 years, it was also suffering from scalping and cheap sales and
				desperately needed to develop new customers. Alongside the unauthorized reselling, another factor that
				destroyed brand equity was the loss of the brand guidelines and design regulations.

					<h4>Solution: Brand Expansion</h4>
					<p>
						The first step to approach the project was rigorous research. It involved sorting out the
						remaining
						products in every size and material and analyzing customer and sales data. Based on the
						examinations and the budget, I restated the brand and adjusted the overall visual design of
						the product.</p>

					<p>
						Determined to create an exciting experience, I designed the package using glimmering silver and
						shimmering black. Although they are usually white or brown, I made protective liners in black to
						enhance the overall visual. This visual makes the budget jump; I solved the issue and logistical
						processes by simplifying the structure and reducing the amount of material.

						efficient distribution process for internal stakeholders.</h3>

					<h4>Solution: design renewal</h4>
					<p>
						Starting by researching the consumer experience, brand history, and surveys in every internal division involved, I set three goals for this project: (1) Preserve the initial brand value, (2) improve the brand communication and out-of-box experience, and (3)clarify the campaign schedule and product release.
					</p>

					<p>
						In executing the new visual design, I continued using the iconic, fresh color scheme of white and green while adjusting the shade to adhere to the upcoming generation.

			<h3>Internal Proposal</h3>
			<p>
				After the market research and competitive analysis, my team and I created a proposal deck to start the project. The 12-page deck begins by showing the renewed brand vision and statement alongside the renewed design. This deck also answers questions that the internal groups should have moving&nbsp;forward.
			</p>

			<p>
				This deck was a rationale for the brand refresh and a translation of a design project for members who are not familiar with brand strategy. A significant chapter in the deck was the development schedule and a plan for both the release schedule and the marketing campaign for the following two years.
