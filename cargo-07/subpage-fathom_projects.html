			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				A big part of my responsibilities at Fathom included content design to tell a compelling story and create case studies for their technology. Execute design projects using the Fathom application, developing client proposals and coming up with graphic language that efficiently reaches out to potential users. All the content aimed to drive the conversation between clients and the company, promoting business opportunities in the&nbsp;industry.

			<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge was that Fathom technology was so new that it was difficult to explain concisely. How would you tell someone that this print technology prints "motion" and you don't need any special material? It looks a bit like lenticular printing, but it's very different from it. What would be the proper application to show people that Fathom is pushing the limitation of print in a cost-effective, environmentally friendly&nbsp;way?

			<h4>SOLUTION</h4>
			<p>
				Fathom did not want their technology to be about beer labels. (Of course, we all love craft beer on the East Coast, but we wanted more.) They wanted to show how package design can look different, advertising can be more unique, and security features can be more robust. Based on the conversation I had with the founders, I came up with different design executions, creating new patterns for the Fathom&nbsp;application.
