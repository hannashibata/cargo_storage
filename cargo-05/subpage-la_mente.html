			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				Since the year 2000, "LA MENTE" hasn't changed its design or brand lineup at all.While the brand was eating up its brand equity for more than 10 years, it was also suffering from scalping and cheap sales and was desperately in need of developing new&nbsp;customers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The refrehing project started with restating the brand, valid research and the proposal, including a new lineup that would apeal to the loyal customers as&nbsp;well.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div class="one-third">
			<h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
			<p>
				As stated in the previous section, brand equity was eaten up, and the brand guideline and design regulations were forgotten over the decade.The research involved sorting out the remaining products in every size and material, and analyzing the data from the customers and sales.Based on the examinations and the budget, I restated the brand and adjusted the overall visual design of the&nbsp;product.

			<h2>EXPANDING THE BRANDSCAPE</h2>

		</div>

		<div class="one-half">
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
				Determined to create an exciting experience, I made the package design using glimmering silver and shimmering black. Although they are usually white or brown, I made protective liners in black to enhance the overall visual. This visual obviously makes the budget jump; I solved the issue and logistical processes by simplifying the structure and reducing the amount of&nbsp;material.

		<div class="one-half">
			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
				Starting by researching the consumer experience, brand history, and surveys in every department involved, I set three goals for this project. “Preserve the initial brand value,” “improve the brand communication and out-of-box experience,” and “clarify the campaign schedule and product&nbsp;release.”</p>
			<p>
				In the execution of the new visual design, I chose to continue using the iconic, fresh color scheme of White x Green but revised it so the brand could adjust to the new digital&nbsp;era.
