			<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
			<p>
				These projects aimed to create a narrative around
				new digital embellishments using the software Fathom Optics was developing. The graphics allowed
				Fathom Optics to efficiently reach out to potential users, and the content drove the conversation
				between clients and the company, promoting their service and sparking business opportunities in
				the&nbsp;
				industry.

			<h4>CHALLENGE & Solution</h4>
			<p>
				The iteration process consists of 3D
				models, creating mockups, drawing blueprints, and creating mockups. The proposals helped clients
				envision what they could do with the technology.
				Since Fathom was trying to reach out specifically to the CPG industry then, I chose this specific
				pattern, "Foilage," to create the image of a luxury skincare brand, and "Ripple" for an audio
				electronics&nbsp;brand.
